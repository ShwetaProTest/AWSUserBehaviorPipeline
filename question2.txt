When designing a pipeline with considerations for potential breakage or failure at any stage, it's essential to consider robustness, resilience, and recovery. creating a more 
effective pipeline while ensuring it remains resilient against potential points of failure:

### 1. **Data Collection & Ingestion**:

#### **Integration with Online Shops**:

1. **APIs**:
   - Implement retries with exponential back-off for transient failures.
   - Use dead-letter queues to capture and analyze failed data ingestion attempts.

2. **Javascript Snippets**:
   - Implement local storage or IndexedDB buffering. If the network fails, captured data can be stored locally and retransmitted when the network is available again.

#### **Data Ingestion Tools**:
- **Amazon Kinesis**:
  - Utilize Kinesis Data Streams’ built-in replication to store data redundantly across multiple AZs (Availability Zones).
  - Monitor shard health and utilize the resharding feature if you notice any bottleneck.

### 2. **Intermediate Storage**:

- **Amazon S3**:
   - Enable versioning to prevent accidental data overwrites or deletions.
   - Use MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Delete to add an additional layer of security against data deletion.

### 3. **Data Processing & Transformation**:

1. **AWS Glue**:
   - Utilize job bookmarks to keep track of data that's already been processed.
   - Monitor job run states and failures with CloudWatch.

2. **Amazon EMR**:
   - Enable EMRFS consistent view to ensure data consistency between EMR and S3.
   - Use Spot instances with EMR’s instance fleets to reduce costs while ensuring that tasks are retried in case of spot terminations.

### 4. **Data Storage for Analytics**:

- **Amazon Redshift**:
   - Implement regular snapshots.
   - Use Redshift’s data validation to ensure data loaded is consistent with the source data.

### 5. **Data Analysis & Visualization**:

- **Amazon Athena**:
   - Validate query results periodically. 
   - Store frequently queried data in optimized formats like Parquet or ORC.

### 6. **Data Retention & Management**:

- **S3 Lifecycle Policies**:
   - Regularly backup data before transitioning or deleting.
   - Implement object lock if necessary to prevent deletions.

### 7. **Monitoring, Security & Compliance**:

- **Amazon CloudWatch**:
   - Set up detailed monitoring and alerts for every stage of the pipeline.
   - Use CloudWatch Logs Insights or third-party tools like ELK stack to gain insights from logs.

- **AWS Lambda**:
   - Use dead-letter queues to capture failed events for debugging.
   - Monitor and set alerts for function failures.

### 8. **Cost Optimization**:

- **Budgets and Alarms**:
   - Use AWS Budgets to monitor costs.
   - Set up billing alarms to get alerted if costs exceed predefined thresholds.

### 9. **Backup & DR**:

- **Data Replication**:
   - Use S3 Cross-Region Replication for critical datasets.
   - Regularly test recovery from backups to ensure data integrity and availability.

### **Conclusion**:
Robustness in a data pipeline means expecting failures and designing for them. Every stage of your pipeline should be instrumented, monitored, and capable of alerting anomalies. Regular testing, like chaos engineering (introducing intentional failures to see how systems cope), can also help ensure resilience. Remember, the key is not to avoid failures – they are inevitable – but to reduce their impact and recover from them rapidly.
